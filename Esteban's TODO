Change the loader: it is trying to load images but the problem is that the main takes them out immediately;
so the loader loads without rest. It needs to check how many tasks are in stock rather than its own list of images
allright this'll be fun
the Loader will now be in another process, and give out tasks 

Change who pilots who! its the main who should be ordering the loader around, not the opposite

Implement the nbProcess: auto mode
    adds more processes if loader is not nearing the end of service and we have not reloaded it in some time, and we do not exceed default number.
    removes a process if task queue hits length 0, and there are more than one process running

Implement the reload: auto mode
    augments the batch size or min loaded img number when the queue hits length 0
    diminishes them if the queue doesn't empty fast enough
