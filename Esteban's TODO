Freaking refactor the config utilities, i hate them so much right now.
    -> refactor the old calls to the configUtilities and check if it all works;

Add an option to remove or not the temp files at the end of the program.
    -> option added but does nothing yet
Add something that makes sure there are no temp files before executing the program.
Add verifications in all the config getters for the files.

Add something that checks that no 2 instances of the app run at the same time.
