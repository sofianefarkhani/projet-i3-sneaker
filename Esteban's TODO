Implement the nbProcess: auto mode
    adds more processes if loader is not nearing the end of service and we have not reloaded it in some time, and we do not exceed default number.
    removes a process if task queue hits length 0, and there are more than one process running

Implement the reload: auto mode
    augments the batch size or min loaded img number when the queue hits length 0
    diminishes them if the queue doesn't empty fast enough
