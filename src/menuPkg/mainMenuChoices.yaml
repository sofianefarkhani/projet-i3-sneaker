#
# this file represents the menu questions and the choices that follow. 
#   'p': print a message, 
#   'c': add a possible choice
#   'disp': declare the name of the choice, 
#   'a': declare an action to do
#
# There are some default actions:
#   'a: _ASK_' : This presents the user with the choices declared right before this line.
#   'a: _LOOP_': This loops the present set of instructions
#
# And a reserved marker: 
#   'set: _NOEXIT_': on the next 'a: _ASK_', no exit option will be displayed.
# If a set of instructions does not end with a loop, user will be sent back to the set of instructions he came from.
#

# maybe i'll add a _LOOP_PARENT_ action
